                After the warehouse receives your return, it generally takes 7
                business days to process your return. Please keep in mind that
                your bank typically posts credit in the billing cycle in which
                it was received. Therefore, the number of days it takes for
                credit to post to your account may vary, depending on your
                banking institution's billing and credit schedule.

                accept or reject the discounted price or partial refund. If you
                reject the discount or partial refund, then in order to obtain
                your refund you will be required to return the product to us
                using an RMA number as described above. If you accept the
                discount or partial refund, you agree to waive your right to
                return this order.
